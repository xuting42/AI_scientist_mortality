# Evaluation Metrics Review: Biological Age Prediction Models

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive review of evaluation metrics for biological age prediction models based on literature analysis. We examine standard regression metrics, biological age-specific measures, clinical validation approaches, and model interpretability assessment methods to establish a complete evaluation framework.

## 1. Standard Regression Metrics

### Primary Performance Metrics

#### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- **Definition**: Average absolute difference between predicted and chronological age
- **Formula**: MAE = (1/n) × Σ|predicted_age - chronological_age|
- **Literature Benchmarks**:
  - **Retinal Age Models**: MAE 2.86-3.30 years (EyeAge, RetiAGE)
  - **Blood Biomarker Models**: MAE 4-8 years (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge)
  - **Brain MRI Models**: MAE 3.55 years (multimodal brain-age)
  - **Metabolomic Models**: MAE 2.79-3.68 years (recent NMR-based clocks)

**Interpretation Guidelines**:
- **Excellent**: MAE < 2.5 years
- **Good**: MAE 2.5-3.5 years
- **Acceptable**: MAE 3.5-4.5 years
- **Poor**: MAE > 4.5 years

#### Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r)
- **Definition**: Linear correlation between predicted and chronological age
- **Literature Benchmarks**:
  - **High Performance**: r > 0.95 (proteomic aging clock)
  - **Good Performance**: r 0.90-0.95 (multimodal approaches)
  - **Acceptable**: r 0.80-0.90 (single modality models)
  - **Minimum Threshold**: r > 0.75 for publication consideration

#### Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- **Definition**: Square root of average squared differences
- **Formula**: RMSE = √[(1/n) × Σ(predicted_age - chronological_age)²]
- **Interpretation**: Penalizes large errors more than MAE
- **Typical Range**: 1.2-1.5 × MAE for well-calibrated models

### Secondary Performance Metrics

#### Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
- **Formula**: MAPE = (100/n) × Σ|((predicted_age - chronological_age)/chronological_age)|
- **Advantage**: Age-relative error measurement
- **Limitation**: Problematic for younger ages (small denominators)

#### Coefficient of Determination (R²)
- **Definition**: Proportion of variance explained by the model
- **Interpretation**: R² > 0.85 indicates strong predictive power
- **Literature Support**: Commonly reported alongside correlation

## 2. Biological Age-Specific Metrics

### Age Gap Analysis

#### Age Acceleration (AA)
- **Definition**: Difference between predicted biological age and chronological age
- **Formula**: AA = Predicted_Age - Chronological_Age
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Positive AA**: Accelerated aging (older biological age)
  - **Negative AA**: Decelerated aging (younger biological age)
  - **Clinical Significance**: AA > 5 years associated with increased mortality risk

#### Age-Adjusted Age Acceleration
- **Definition**: Age acceleration after regression adjustment for chronological age
- **Purpose**: Remove correlation with chronological age inherent in biological age measures
- **Implementation**: Residuals from linear regression of predicted age on chronological age
- **Literature Support**: Standard approach in epigenetic clock research

### Mortality Prediction Metrics

#### Hazard Ratios (HR)
- **Definition**: Risk increase per unit change in biological age or age acceleration
- **Literature Benchmarks**:
  - **Per year age acceleration**: HR 1.026-1.09 for all-cause mortality
  - **Per standard deviation**: HR 1.2-1.5 for mortality risk
  - **Retinal Age Gap**: HR 1.026 (adjusted for phenotypic age)
  - **Metabolomic Age**: HR 1.04-1.09 per SD increase

#### Concordance Index (C-index)
- **Definition**: Probability that model correctly ranks pairs of individuals by survival time
- **Interpretation**: C-index > 0.65 indicates meaningful predictive value for mortality
- **Comparison**: Should exceed chronological age alone (baseline C-index ~0.60-0.65)

#### Area Under Curve (AUC) for Time-to-Event
- **Application**: 5-year, 10-year mortality prediction
- **Literature Benchmarks**: AUC > 0.70 for clinical utility
- **Comparison Baseline**: Chronological age + basic demographics

## 3. Clinical Validation Metrics

### Disease Risk Prediction

#### Disease-Specific AUC
- **Cardiovascular Disease**: Target AUC > 0.75
- **Cancer Risk**: Target AUC > 0.70  
- **Neurodegenerative Disease**: Target AUC > 0.70
- **Diabetes**: Target AUC > 0.80

#### Odds Ratios (OR)
- **Definition**: Risk increase per unit biological age acceleration
- **Literature Examples**:
  - **Cancer Risk**: OR 1.04-1.09 per year age acceleration
  - **CVD Risk**: OR 1.05-1.12 per year acceleration
  - **Diabetes**: OR 1.20 per year acceleration

### Cross-Sectional Validation

#### Age-Related Biomarker Associations
- **Inflammatory Markers**: Correlation with CRP, IL-6, TNF-α levels
- **Physical Function**: Association with grip strength, gait speed
- **Cognitive Function**: Correlation with fluid intelligence, memory tests
- **Frailty Measures**: Association with frailty phenotype components

#### Population Health Metrics
- **Healthy vs. Diseased**: Significant age acceleration in disease groups
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Expected associations with smoking, exercise, diet
- **Socioeconomic Status**: Relationship with education, income, occupation

## 4. Model Interpretability Assessment
