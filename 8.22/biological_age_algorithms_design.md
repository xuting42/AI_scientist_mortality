## Algorithm 1: Hierarchical Elastic Net with Adaptive Weighting (HENAW)
### Cost-Effective Clinical Implementation Using Blood Biomarkers Only

#### 1.1 Mathematical Formulation

**Core Architecture:**
```
BA_HENAW = f(X_blood) = α₀ + Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ αᵢ·h(xᵢ) + Σⱼ₌₁ᵐ βⱼ·g(xᵢ,xⱼ)
```

Where:
- `X_blood` = {CRP, HbA1c, Creatinine, Albumin, Lymphocyte%, RDW, GGT, AST, ALT}
- `h(xᵢ)` = Non-linear transformation: log(1 + |xᵢ - μᵢ|/σᵢ)
- `g(xᵢ,xⱼ)` = Interaction terms for biological pathways
- `α, β` = Learnable weights with hierarchical constraints

**Hierarchical Structure:**
```
Level 1: Individual biomarkers
Level 2: Biological systems
  - Inflammation: {CRP, Lymphocyte%}
  - Metabolism: {HbA1c, GGT, ALT, AST}
  - Organ function: {Creatinine, Albumin}
  - Hematology: {RDW, Lymphocyte%}
Level 3: Integrated biological age
```

#### 1.2 Feature Engineering Strategy

**Transformation Pipeline:**
1. **Normalization**: Age-sex specific z-scores using sliding window (±5 years)
2. **Non-linearity Capture**: 
   - Power transforms for skewed distributions
   - Piecewise linear splines for threshold effects
3. **Interaction Features**:
   - CRP × HbA1c (inflammation-metabolism)
   - Creatinine × Albumin (kidney-liver axis)
   - AST/ALT ratio (liver damage pattern)

**Adaptive Weighting Mechanism:**
```
w_i(t) = exp(-λ·CV_i(t)) / Σⱼ exp(-λ·CV_j(t))
```
Where CV_i(t) is the coefficient of variation for biomarker i at age t

#### 1.3 Training Procedure

**Loss Function:**
```
L = L_age + λ₁·L_mortality + λ₂·L_morbidity + λ₃·R_elastic
```

Components:
- `L_age`: MSE between predicted and chronological age
- `L_mortality`: Cox proportional hazards for all-cause mortality
- `L_morbidity`: Multi-task learning for age-related diseases
- `R_elastic`: α·||w||₁ + (1-α)·||w||₂² with hierarchical constraints

**Optimization Strategy:**
1. Initialize with elastic net on chronological age
2. Fine-tune with mortality/morbidity outcomes
3. Apply hierarchical constraint: ||β_system|| ≤ C·||α_individual||
4. Cross-validation with stratified age groups

#### 1.4 Clinical Interpretability

```
AgeGap_HENAW = BA_HENAW - CA
Aging_Rate = d(BA_HENAW)/dt
```

**Feature Attribution:**
- SHAP values for individual biomarker contributions
- System-level importance scores
- Personalized aging pathway identification

**Risk Stratification:**
- Tertiles: Slow/Normal/Accelerated aging
- Continuous risk score: σ(AgeGap_HENAW/5)

- C-statistic for 10-year mortality: Target > 0.75
- Test-retest reliability (ICC): Target > 0.85

**Cost-Effectiveness:**
- Total biomarker cost: ~£50-75 per assessment
- Computation time: < 100ms per individual
- No specialized equipment required

Q_blood = W_Q^blood · z_blood
K_retinal = W_K^retinal · [z_OCT; z_fundus]
V_retinal = W_V^retinal · [z_OCT; z_fundus]

z_attended = MultiHead(Q_blood, K_retinal, V_retinal)
```

z_fused = γ₁·z_blood + γ₂·z_attended + γ₃·(z_blood ⊙ z_attended)
```
Where γ are learnable gating parameters

**Hypernetwork for Personalization:**

θ_personal = HyperNet(demographics)
BA = FC_θ_personal(z_fused)
```

#### 2.3 Missing Data Handling

**Modality Dropout Training:**

- Learned modality importance weights: w_m = σ(FC(available_modalities))

**Imputation Strategy:**
```
If X_OCT missing: z_OCT = E_proxy^OCT(z_fundus, z_blood)
If X_fundus missing: z_fundus = E_proxy^fundus(z_OCT, z_blood)
```

#### 2.4 Training Procedure

**Multi-Task Learning Framework:**
```
L_total = L_age + λ₁·L_RAG + λ₂·L_disease + λ₃·L_consistency
```

Components:

- `L_RAG`: Auxiliary task for Retinal Age Gap
- `L_disease`: Binary cross-entropy for disease onset
- `L_consistency`: Cross-modal consistency regularization

**Progressive Training:**
1. Pre-train modality encoders independently
2. Freeze encoders, train attention mechanism
3. Fine-tune end-to-end with all losses
4. Knowledge distillation from ensemble

#### 2.5 Uncertainty Quantification

**Epistemic Uncertainty:**
```
BA_mean, BA_var = MC_Dropout(X, n_samples=30)
Confidence = 1 / (1 + BA_var)
```

**Aleatoric Uncertainty:**
```
Output: [BA_mean, log(BA_var)]
Loss: -log N(y | BA_mean, BA_var)
```
