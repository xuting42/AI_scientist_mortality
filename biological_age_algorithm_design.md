# HENAW: Hierarchical Ensemble Network for Adaptive-Weight Biological Age Assessment

## A Novel Multi-Modal Deep Architecture for Continuous Biological Age Scoring

---

## Algorithm Overview

**HENAW** (Hierarchical Ensemble Network with Adaptive Weighting) represents a paradigm shift in biological age computation by introducing a hierarchical, organ-system-specific architecture that dynamically adapts feature importance based on individual health profiles. Unlike existing methods that produce single point estimates, HENAW generates a continuous biological age distribution with confidence intervals and organ-specific aging trajectories.

### Core Innovation

The algorithm introduces three fundamental innovations:

1. **Hierarchical Organ-System Decomposition**: Rather than treating aging as a monolithic process, HENAW decomposes biological age into five organ-system clocks (metabolic, cardiovascular, hepatorenal, inflammatory, and neural-retinal), each trained independently before hierarchical integration.

2. **Adaptive Feature Weighting via Attention Mechanisms**: The algorithm dynamically adjusts biomarker importance based on individual health profiles using a novel health-state-aware attention mechanism, allowing personalized aging assessment.

3. **Probabilistic Age Distribution Output**: Instead of point estimates, HENAW outputs a probability distribution over biological ages, quantifying uncertainty and enabling risk stratification.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Conceptual Formulation

The HENAW framework models biological age as a hierarchical latent variable:

**Level 1 - Organ-System Clocks:**
```
BA_organ = f_organ(X_organ; θ_organ) + ε_organ
```

Where each organ system (metabolic, cardiovascular, etc.) has its dedicated feature set X_organ and learned parameters θ_organ.

**Level 2 - Adaptive Integration:**
```
BA_integrated = Σ(α_i(H) × BA_organ_i)
```

Where α_i(H) represents health-state-dependent attention weights derived from the individual's health profile H.

**Level 3 - Probabilistic Output:**
```
P(BA | X) = N(μ_BA, σ_BA²)
```

The final output is a normal distribution with learned mean and variance, capturing prediction uncertainty.

### Theoretical Foundation

HENAW builds on three theoretical principles:

1. **Information Bottleneck Theory**: Each organ-system encoder compresses information to retain only aging-relevant features, reducing noise and improving generalization.

2. **Hierarchical Bayesian Framework**: The multi-level structure allows borrowing statistical strength across organ systems while maintaining system-specific patterns.

3. **Adaptive Resonance Theory**: The attention mechanism resonates with dominant aging patterns in an individual's profile, amplifying relevant signals.

## Architecture Specification

### High-Level Structure

HENAW employs a three-tier architecture:

**Tier 1: Organ-System Encoders**
- Five parallel deep networks, each specialized for one organ system
- Each encoder uses domain-specific architectures (e.g., GRU for temporal metabolomics, CNN for retinal features)
- Produces 128-dimensional aging embeddings per organ system

**Tier 2: Cross-System Attention Module**
- Multi-head self-attention across organ-system embeddings
- Health-state conditioning via cross-attention with clinical indicators
- Generates weighted combination coefficients

**Tier 3: Probabilistic Age Decoder**
- Mixture density network outputting Gaussian parameters
- Incorporates chronological age as prior information
- Produces confidence-calibrated age distributions

### Data Flow Architecture

```
Input Features → Organ-System Encoders → Attention Integration → Probabilistic Decoder → BA Distribution
        ↓                                           ↑
   Feature Selection                    Health State Conditioning
```

## Feature Engineering Strategy

### Multi-Modal Feature Groups

**Group 1: Core Clinical (30 features)**
- Prioritized based on acquisition cost and clinical availability
- Includes all PhenoAge and KDM markers
- Enhanced with UK Biobank-specific inflammatory markers

**Group 2: NMR Metabolomic Signature (50 selected from 249)**
- Novel dimension reduction using metabolic pathway clustering
- Focus on aging-associated pathways: lipid metabolism, amino acid turnover, energy metabolism
- Temporal stability filtering to reduce batch effects

**Group 3: Body Composition Dynamics (15 features)**
- Sarcopenia indicators: appendicular lean mass indices
- Visceral adiposity measures
- Bone-muscle-fat ratios

**Group 4: OCT Retinal Features (20 features)**
- Layer-specific thickness gradients
- Macular symmetry indices
- Novel vascular topology metrics

### Feature Selection Philosophy

Rather than exhaustive inclusion, HENAW employs a three-phase selection:

1. **Biological Relevance Filtering**: Features must have established aging associations in literature
2. **Statistical Power Assessment**: Minimum effect size thresholds based on 500,739 cohort
3. **Clinical Feasibility Scoring**: Weighted by measurement cost, expertise requirements, and availability

## Training Methodology

### Hierarchical Training Protocol

**Phase 1: Organ-System Pre-training**
- Each encoder trained independently on organ-specific outcomes
- Metabolic clock validated against diabetes onset
- Cardiovascular clock against CV events
- Creates specialized representations

**Phase 2: Integration Learning**
- Freeze organ encoders, train attention mechanism
- Learn optimal weighting schemes across health states
- Validate against all-cause mortality

**Phase 3: End-to-End Fine-tuning**
- Unfreeze all parameters for joint optimization
- Incorporate longitudinal consistency loss
- Calibrate uncertainty estimates

### Loss Function Design

HENAW uses a composite loss function:

```
L_total = L_age + λ₁L_mortality + λ₂L_consistency + λ₃L_calibration
```

Where:
- L_age: Primary age prediction loss (Gaussian negative log-likelihood)
- L_mortality: Survival analysis loss for mortality prediction
- L_consistency: Temporal consistency across repeat measurements
- L_calibration: Uncertainty calibration loss

## Feature Importance Strategy

### Hierarchical Attribution

**Level 1: Organ System Contributions**
- Quantify each organ clock's contribution to final age

### Biological Pathway Mapping

Features are mapped to established aging hallmarks:
- Genomic instability (via inflammatory markers)
- Telomere attrition (indirectly via cellular markers)
- Epigenetic alterations (via metabolomic proxies)
- Loss of proteostasis (via protein markers)
- Mitochondrial dysfunction (via metabolic markers)

## Clinical Translation Framework

### Interpretable Outputs

**Primary Output: Biological Age Report Card**
- Overall biological age with confidence interval
- Organ-specific aging rates (e.g., "Heart Age: 52 ± 3 years")
- Percentile rankings within age/sex groups

**Secondary Output: Intervention Targets**

### Risk Stratification

HENAW generates three risk tiers:
1. **Optimal Aging**: BA < CA - 5 years
2. **Normal Aging**: BA within ±5 years of CA
3. **Accelerated Aging**: BA > CA + 5 years

Each tier triggers different clinical pathways and monitoring frequencies.
