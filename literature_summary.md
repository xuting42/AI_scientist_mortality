# Literature Summary: Multimodal Machine Learning for Biological Age Prediction

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive literature review synthesizes current research on biological age prediction using multimodal machine learning approaches, with focus on UK Biobank data and various biomarkers. The analysis covers 50+ high-quality publications spanning biological age fundamentals, multimodal fusion strategies, retinal aging biomarkers, and modality-specific features for aging assessment.

## 1. Biological Age Prediction Fundamentals

### Key Concepts and Methods

**Biological vs. Chronological Age**: Biological age reflects physiological state rather than chronological time, providing better prediction of health outcomes and mortality risk. Research consistently shows biological age outperforms chronological age in mortality prediction (hazard ratio improvements of 9-51% across studies).

**Epigenetic Clocks Evolution**:
- **First Generation**: Horvath (353 CpG sites, MAE ~4 years), Hannum (71 CpG sites)
- **Second Generation**: PhenoAge (513 CpG sites), GrimAge - superior mortality prediction
- **Recent Advances (2023-2024)**: Universal pan-mammalian clocks (MAE 2.86-3.30 years), population-specific models for diverse ethnicities

## 3. Multimodal Machine Learning in Healthcare

### Fusion Strategies

**Three Main Approaches**:
1. **Early Fusion (Input-level)**: Most commonly used, concatenates modalities at input
2. **Intermediate Fusion**: Single-level, hierarchical, and attention-based fusion
3. **Late Fusion (Output-level)**: Combines predictions from separate modality-specific models

**Architecture Preferences**: CNNs (65 studies), FCNNs (10), Auto-encoders (8), Transformers (6), emerging GNNs for non-Euclidean relationships.

### Recent Advances

**Transformer Applications**: TransMed combines CNN and transformer for multimodal medical imaging, showing superior performance in capturing global features and cross-modal relationships.

## 5. Modality-Specific Features and Aging Associations

### Blood Biochemistry

**Key Biomarkers**:
- **Inflammatory**: CRP (independent CVD risk factor), IL-6 (most robust disease/mortality association), TNF-α
- **Metabolic**: Fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c, lipid profiles (total/HDL/LDL cholesterol, triglycerides)
- **Organ Function**: Creatinine (kidney), albumin (liver), alkaline phosphatase

**Clinical Significance**: Seven glycemic, lipid, and inflammatory biomarkers significantly predict healthspan and lifespan. CRP activates NF-κB pathway, promoting aging via Smad3-dependent mechanisms.

**Age-Related Changes**:
- **Sarcopenia**: 3-8% muscle mass decline per decade after age 30
- **Fat Distribution**: Increased visceral adipose tissue, particularly post-menopause
- **Bone Density**: Progressive decline detected by DXA before clinical manifestation

**Biomarker Associations**: Inflammatory markers (CRP), hormonal changes (growth hormone, testosterone decline), metabolic markers correlate with body composition changes.

### Neuroimaging (Brain MRI)

**BrainAGE Method**: Most widely applied brain age prediction using structural MRI, with brain-age delta indicating accelerated/decelerated aging.

**DunedinPACNI**: Recent breakthrough using 315 structural brain measures to predict aging rates from single MRI scan, comparable accuracy to DNA methylation methods.

### Physical Function and Frailty

**Grip Strength**: "Indispensable biomarker" for older adults, predicts multi-morbidity, disability, mortality. Component of five physical frailty criteria.

**Frailty Phenotype**: Unintentional weight loss, weakness, exhaustion, slow gait, low physical activity. Associated with inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6, TNF-α, CRP).

**Mental Health Connection**: Grip strength inversely correlated with depression across multiple countries. Antidepressant use negatively associated with grip strength.

**Molecular Aging**: Weak grip strength correlates with accelerated DNA aging, shorter telomeres, cellular senescence markers.
