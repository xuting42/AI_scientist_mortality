## 10. Conclusions

The field of biological age prediction has advanced significantly from 2020-2025, with three major trends emerging:

1. **Convergence of Methods**: Increasing integration of multiple data modalities
2. **Clinical Translation**: Movement toward implementable clinical tools
3. **Personalized Medicine**: Recognition of individual aging trajectories

The UK Biobank has proven instrumental in validating and developing these approaches, offering unparalleled multi-modal data at population scale. The most promising avenue for novel algorithm development appears to be the integration of retinal imaging with selective molecular markers, offering a balance of accuracy, practicality, and clinical utility.

Future work should focus on:
- Developing cost-effective, clinically implementable algorithms
- Validating interventions that modify biological age
- Creating personalized aging trajectories rather than point estimates
- Ensuring equity through diverse population validation
