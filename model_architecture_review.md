# Model Architecture Review: Multimodal Fusion Strategies for Biological Age Prediction

## Executive Summary

This document reviews multimodal fusion architectures for biological age prediction based on comprehensive literature analysis. We analyze three main fusion strategies (early, intermediate, late), evaluate pros and cons of different approaches, and provide specific architecture recommendations suitable for UK Biobank multimodal data integration.

## 1. Taxonomy of Multimodal Fusion Strategies

### Traditional Classification

#### Early Fusion (Input-Level Fusion)
- **Definition**: Concatenates raw features from different modalities before model training
- **Implementation**: Direct feature concatenation → Single unified model
- **Literature Prevalence**: Most commonly used strategy (11/17 studies in systematic reviews)
- **Typical Use**: Feature vectors from tabular data combined with image embeddings

#### Intermediate Fusion (Joint/Mid-Level Fusion)
- **Definition**: Combines features at various intermediate levels within network architecture
- **Subtypes**: 
  - Single-level fusion: Combination at one intermediate layer
  - Hierarchical fusion: Multi-level feature combination
  - Attention-based fusion: Learnable attention mechanisms for modality weighting
- **Implementation**: Modality-specific encoders → Feature fusion → Joint decoder

#### Late Fusion (Output-Level Fusion)
- **Definition**: Combines predictions from separately trained modality-specific models
- **Implementation**: Independent models per modality → Decision-level combination
- **Combination Methods**: Majority voting, weighted averaging, ensemble learning

### Modern Deep Learning Taxonomy

Recent literature suggests traditional categories insufficient for deep learning era. New classification:

#### 1. Encoder-Decoder Methods
- **Architecture**: Separate encoders per modality + shared decoder
- **Advantages**: Modality-specific feature learning + joint representation
- **Examples**: Multimodal autoencoders, cross-modal reconstruction networks

#### 2. Attention Mechanism Methods  
- **Architecture**: Cross-modal attention for selective feature emphasis
- **Advantages**: Learns importance weights for different modality contributions
- **Examples**: Transformer-based fusion, multimodal attention networks

#### 3. Graph Neural Network Methods
- **Architecture**: Graph representations modeling cross-modal relationships
- **Advantages**: Handles non-Euclidean relationships between modalities
- **Examples**: Heterogeneous graph networks, knowledge graph embeddings

#### 4. Generative Neural Network Methods
- **Architecture**: Generative models for cross-modal learning and fusion
- **Advantages**: Handles missing modalities, learns shared latent space
- **Examples**: Variational autoencoders (VAE), generative adversarial networks (GAN)

## 2. Architecture Analysis by Modality Combination

### Image + Tabular Data Fusion

#### CNN + MLP Architecture
```
Fundus Image → CNN Encoder → Feature Vector (512D)
                                        ↓
Tabular Data → MLP Encoder → Feature Vector (256D)
                                        ↓
               Concatenation → Joint MLP → Age Prediction
```

**Advantages**:

```

**Literature Support**: TransMed architecture combines CNN and Transformer for multimodal medical imaging, showing superior performance in capturing global features and cross-modal relationships.

### Multi-Image + Tabular Fusion

#### Hierarchical CNN Architecture
```

Brain MRI → Shared CNN → Individual Feature Maps
                ↓
        Concatenation + Attention → Image Features
                ↓
        Tabular Data → MLP → Clinical Features
                ↓
        Final Fusion → Age Prediction
```

### Time-Series + Static Feature Fusion
