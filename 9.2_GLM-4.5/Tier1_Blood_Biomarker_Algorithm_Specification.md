# Tier 1: Blood Biomarker Foundation Algorithm - Technical Implementation Specification

## Executive Summary

This document provides detailed technical specifications for implementing the Tier 1 Blood Biomarker Foundation Algorithm, designed to process data from 604,514 UK Biobank participants. The algorithm serves as the foundation for the multi-modal biological age prediction system, with a focus on robustness, interpretability, and clinical utility.

## 1. Algorithm Architecture: Clinical Biomarker Aging Network (CBAN)

### 1.1 Core Mathematical Framework

The CBAN algorithm implements a hierarchical prediction system that combines traditional statistical methods with machine learning for optimal biological age estimation.

**Primary Prediction Equation:**
```
BioAge = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ... + βₙXₙ + ε
where:
- Xᵢ represents engineered features from blood biomarkers
- βᵢ are learned coefficients with regularization
- ε represents prediction uncertainty
```

**Ensemble Architecture:**
```
Final_BioAge = w₁*EBM_pred + w₂*XGBoost_pred + w₃*RF_pred + w₄*LR_pred
where:
- EBM = Explainable Boosting Machine (primary)
- XGBoost = Gradient boosting (secondary)
- RF = Random Forest (diversity)
- LR = Linear Regression (baseline)
- wᵢ are optimized weights summing to 1.0
```

                       + β₁₀*BP_Medication + ε

Training Strategy:
1. Pre-train on external datasets with both blood biomarkers and epigenetic data
2. Transfer learning to UK Biobank using domain adaptation
