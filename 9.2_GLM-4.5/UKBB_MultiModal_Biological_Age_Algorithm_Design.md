# UK Biobank Multi-Modal Biological Age Algorithm Design

## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive biological age algorithm design that integrates UK Biobank's multimodal data assets while addressing key limitations including the absence of epigenetic data, population biases, and variable data availability. The algorithm employs a tiered approach that allows progressive enhancement from blood biomarkers to full multimodal integration, with novel methodological innovations for handling missing data and ensuring clinical interpretability.

## 1. Core Algorithm Architecture: Hierarchical Adaptive Multi-modal Biological Age Estimation (HAMBAE)

### 1.1 Conceptual Foundation

The HAMBAE algorithm is built on the principle that biological aging manifests across multiple interconnected biological systems, each providing complementary information about the aging process. The architecture addresses the fundamental challenge of integrating heterogeneous data types while maintaining robustness to missing data and ensuring clinical interpretability.

**Mathematical Framework:**
```
Biological_Age = f(Blood, Metabolomics, Retinal, Genetic, Lifestyle)
               = ∑ w_i * f_i(X_i) + ε_i + ε_interactions

where:
- w_i = adaptive weights based on data quality and availability
- f_i = modality-specific transformation functions
- ε_i = modality-specific uncertainty
- ε_interactions = cross-modal interaction effects
```

### 1.2 Key Innovations

1. **Adaptive Modality Weighting**: Dynamic adjustment of modality importance based on data quality and individual participant characteristics
2. **Missing Data Resilience**: Novel imputation strategy using cross-modal correlations and population priors
3. **Epigenetic Proxy Development**: Creation of synthetic epigenetic age estimates using available biomarkers
4. **Longitudinal Aging Velocity**: Incorporation of temporal change patterns for dynamic age assessment
5. **Clinical Explainability**: Multi-level interpretability from individual biomarkers to biological pathways

## 2. Tier 1: Blood Biomarker Foundation Algorithm (604,514 participants)

### 2.1 Algorithm Design: Clinical Biomarker Aging Network (CBAN)

**Core Architecture:**
```
Input: [13 core biomarkers + demographics + clinical covariates]
→ Feature Engineering (biological ratios, interactions, trajectories)
→ Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) with SHAP interpretability
→ Uncertainty Quantification (Bayesian ensemble)
→ Output: Biological Age + Confidence Intervals + Feature Importance
```

**Feature Engineering Pipeline:**
1. **Primary Biomarkers**: Albumin, Glucose, Alkaline Phosphatase, Urea, IGF-1, Cholesterol, HDL, LDL, Triglycerides, HbA1c, Creatinine, Bilirubin
2. **Derived Ratios**: Cholesterol/HDL, LDL/HDL, Albumin/Globulin, etc.
3. **Interaction Terms**: Age × biomarker interactions, sex-specific effects
4. **Clinical Context**: BMI, blood pressure, medication status, comorbidities

**Novel Components:**

                       + β₆*Age + β₇*Sex + β₈*BMI + ε
```

This proxy is trained on external datasets with both blood biomarkers and epigenetic data, then transferred to UK Biobank population.

**Longitudinal Aging Velocity:**
```
Aging_Velocity = d(Biomarker)/dt = Σ(w_i * Δbiomarker_i/Δt)
```

Where velocity is estimated using available longitudinal measurements and Gaussian process smoothing.
