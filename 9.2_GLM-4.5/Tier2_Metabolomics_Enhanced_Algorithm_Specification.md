## 1. Algorithm Architecture: Metabolic Network Aging Integrator (MNAI)

### 1.1 Core Mathematical Framework

The MNAI algorithm implements a sophisticated graph-based approach that models metabolic interactions and pathway-level aging signatures.

**Primary Prediction Architecture:**
```
BioAge_Metabolic = f(Blood_Biomarkers, Metabolic_Network, Pathway_Scores)
                = w₁*CBAN_pred + w₂*GNN_pred + w₃*Pathway_pred + w₄*Interaction_pred

where:
- CBAN_pred = Tier 1 blood biomarker prediction
- GNN_pred = Graph neural network prediction from metabolic interactions
- Pathway_pred = Pathway-level aging scores
- Interaction_pred = Cross-modal interaction effects
- wᵢ are learned weights with adaptive regularization
```

**Graph Neural Network Formulation:**
```
Node Features: Hᵢ = [metabolite_concentration, metabolite_ratio, temporal_features]
Edge Features: Eᵢⱼ = [biochemical_interaction, correlation_strength, pathway_co_membership]

Graph Convolution: Hᵢ^(l+1) = σ(∑ⱼ∈N(i)∪{i} (1/cᵢⱼ) * W^(l) * Hⱼ^(l))
where:
- N(i) = neighbors of node i
